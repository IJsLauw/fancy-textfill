# Change Log

## 1.2.0

* Support for `line-height` with value `normal`
* A new option has been created to explicitely treat `line-height` as a fixed value (not relative to the current `font-size`).
* Refactoring of the code

## 1.1.1

* Floor the optimal `font-size` to avoid rounding errors. Thanks to @Robinfr for PR #2.
